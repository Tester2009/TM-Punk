TM Punk

How this tool work ?

TM Punk is PHP CLI hacking tool that are able to scan for Streamyx (Malaysia Internet Service Provider) IP range to find public router and able to steal username & password for that router. This tool can also remotely reboot any public router.

Note : This tool I think only work in Malaysian IP Address because this flaw only known work in Malaysia.
